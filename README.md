### ExcelProject

#### This project highlights my understanding of utilizing Excel to extract, clean and visualize data to solve problems. By utilizing important Excel functions like XLOOKUP() and creating a viewer experience with data for easy interpetation. 

This data contains information about people around the US who drink select coffee, their personal information, customer IDs and whether they have an ID loyalty card with the company. 

This data was taken from Kaggle.

#### Performance Analysis:
 How effective is the loyalty card program in retaining customers and increasing sales?
 
###### Answer using Dashboard: By using the month data slider we can observe that over the course of 2019 - 2022 and by comparing January (beginning of the year sales), the loyalty card program members sales have been increasing and new top 5 customers are apparent each year. This can show that the program may be retaining customers but more information would be need to be sure. 
 
#### Data-Drive Decision Making:
 Should there be adjustments in pricing or promotions for select coffee products based on customer demographics or buying behavior?

###### Answer using Dashboard: According to the line graph in the dashboard Robusta coffee products have sold the least throughout the 3 years the data provides. Considering a pricing change or a promotion to put more attention on the least sold product may help spike more sales for Robusta coffee products!
